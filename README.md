# Word-Guess-Game

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a word-guess/hangman game using HTML,CSS and Javascript. Going into the project, we had only brief exposure to Javascript and had to be resourceful in learning how to accomplish this task. The main features required was a random word generator to pick a word from an array, an event listener to listen for the users word choice and compare it to the chosen word and a way for the user to win and start a new game. Currently, this version of the game is not fully functional as I am still working to fix some bugs.
